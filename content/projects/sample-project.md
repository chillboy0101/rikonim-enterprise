## Scope

- Traffic management and staged construction plan
- Reinforced concrete substructure and deck works
- Stormwater drainage channel improvements and outfall protection
- Road furniture, signage, and line marking

## Delivery approach

We prioritised safety controls, clear workfront separation, and quality assurance checks at each stage. Works were scheduled to maintain corridor access during peak hours and minimise disruption.

## Outcomes

- Improved traffic reliability through grade separation
- Reduced surface water ponding with upgraded drainage
- Safer pedestrian crossing points and improved wayfinding
